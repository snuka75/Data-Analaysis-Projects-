NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions - Data Science Project
This project uses the NYC OpenData Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset, which contains detailed information on motor vehicle collisions reported by the police in New York City. The dataset includes attributes such as crash locations, vehicle types, contributing factors, and the number of persons involved. The goal of this project is to explore and analyze the data to derive insights that can inform strategies for improving road safety, especially for vulnerable road users.

Project Overview:
Objective: Analyze trends in motor vehicle collisions, identify high-risk areas, and propose recommendations for reducing crashes.
Dataset: NYC Motor Vehicle Collisions - Crashes dataset from NYC OpenData.
Analysis: Explore the relationship between crash frequency and factors such as time of day, intersection geometry, and community demographics. Visualizations and models are built using Python, Power BI, Tableau, or other relevant tools.
Visualization: Utilize inclusive colorblind-friendly palettes to ensure accessibility in visual communication.
Tools: Google Colab, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Excel, Power BI, Tableau.
This repository contains the code and documentation to help you replicate the analysis and insights derived from the data.
